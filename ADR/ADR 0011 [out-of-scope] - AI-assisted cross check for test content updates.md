# 0011 AI-assisted cross check for test content updates

## Status

In progress - to be refined and discussed further

## Context

When we apply significant changes to the existing test or introduce a new one, it is crucial to ensure that the questions are clear and that the answers can be accurately assessed by our AI-assisted verification system. To achieve this, we propose a new feature where AI will be used to answer the test questions, and these answers will be fed into the existing AI-assisted assessment system. This process will provide our moderators with a clear indication of the clarity of the questions and the accuracy of the AI-assisted verification system.

## Decision

We will implement a Cross-AI Verification feature for new and significantly modified tests. This feature will involve using AI to generate answers for the test questions, which will then be assessed by our existing AI-assisted verification system. The results will help moderators determine the clarity of the questions and the effectiveness of the AI-assisted assessment system.

## Consequences

1. **Improved Clarity**: Moderators will receive clear indications on whether the test questions are understandable and unambiguous.
2. **Enhanced Accuracy**: By verifying the AI's ability to assess the generated answers, we can ensure that the AI-assisted verification system is functioning correctly and accurately.
3. **Efficiency**: Automating the initial verification process will save time for moderators, allowing them to focus on more complex issues.
4. **Quality Assurance**: Continuous verification of new and modified tests will help maintain the quality and reliability of our assessments.
5. **Risk Management**: Identifying potential issues with test questions and the AI-assisted verification system early on, will help mitigate risks associated with incorrect assessments.

By implementing this feature, we aim to enhance the clarity and accuracy of our test questions and the effectiveness of our AI-assisted verification system.
