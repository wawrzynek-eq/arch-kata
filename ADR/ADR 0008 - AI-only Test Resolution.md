# 0008 AI-only Test Resolution

## Context

Contract deadlines require certification assessments to be completed within a strict timeframe. However, there are instances where human reviewers may not be available to perform these assessments due to various constraints such as time, availability, or volume of applications. To address this issue, we propose the introduction of an automatic AI-generated assessment to be used in extreme conditions. This system will generate results without human intervention, ensuring that deadlines are met.

The policy for including disclaimers on AI-generated results is crucial when human confirmation is not possible. This policy should be configurable based on business decisions and regulatory requirements. Additionally, the system should be able to stop the AI-only test resolution if a certain, configurable threshold for AI result confidence is not met, ensuring that only high-confidence results are used without human review.

## Decision

We will implement an AI-only test resolution for certification assessments in scenarios where human review is not feasible before contract deadlines. This system will automatically generate assessment results and include appropriate disclaimers indicating that the results were generated by AI without human review. Furthermore, the system will include a configurable threshold for AI result confidence. If the AI result confidence does not meet this threshold, the AI-only test resolution will be stopped, and the assessment will require human review.

## Consequences

1. **Compliance**: Ensures that certification assessments are completed within contract deadlines, maintaining compliance.
2. **Efficiency**: Reduces the dependency on human reviewers, allowing for faster processing of assessments.
3. **Transparency**: Clearly communicates to stakeholders that the results are AI-assisted and may require further human review when possible.
4. **Configurable Policy**: Allows the business to configure the use of AI-only assessments based on specific needs and regulatory guidelines.
5. **Risk Management**: Identifies and mitigates potential risks associated with AI-assisted assessments by including disclaimers and maintaining transparency. The configurable threshold for AI result confidence ensures that only high-confidence results are used without human review, further managing risks.

By implementing this approach, we ensure that the AI-only test resolution is both efficient and reliable, with safeguards in place to maintain the quality and accuracy of the assessments.
