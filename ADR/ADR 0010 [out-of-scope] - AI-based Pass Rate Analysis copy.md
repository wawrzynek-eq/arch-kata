# 0010 AI-based Pass Rate Analysis

# Status

In progress - to be refined and discussed further

# Context

To ensure the quality and fairness of our test questions, it is important to continuously analyze their performance and the pass rates of candidates. Manual analysis can be time-consuming and may not capture all nuances. By leveraging AI, we can automate the analysis of test questions and candidate pass rates, providing insights and suggesting improvements or modifications to the test questions. This will help maintain the integrity and effectiveness of our assessments.

# Decision

We will extend our system with a new feature that uses AI to analyze the pass rates of current test questions. The AI will identify patterns and trends in the data, highlighting questions that may be too difficult, too easy, or potentially ambiguous. Based on this analysis, the AI will suggest improvements or modifications to the test questions to ensure they are fair and effective.

# Consequences

1. **Improved Quality**: The AI-based analysis will help identify and improve test questions that may not be performing as expected, ensuring a higher quality of assessments.
2. **Efficiency**: Automating the analysis process will save time and resources, allowing human reviewers to focus on more complex tasks.
3. **Fairness**: By continuously monitoring and adjusting test questions based on pass rate data, we can ensure that our assessments are fair and unbiased.
4. **Data-Driven Insights**: The AI will provide data-driven insights into the performance of test questions, helping to make informed decisions about modifications and improvements.
5. **Scalability**: The AI-based analysis system can handle large volumes of data, making it scalable as the number of test questions and candidates increases.

By implementing this feature, we aim to enhance the overall effectiveness and fairness of our assessments through continuous, automated analysis and improvement of test questions.
