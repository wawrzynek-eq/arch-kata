## 1. Introduction

Hello everyone!
We call ourselves KnowledgeOutOfRangeException and today we'd like to show you our humble proposition for how to improve the grading system with AI-assisted solutions. Without any further ado... Let's crack on!

### Notes
 - How about a personal touch - our photos on the first slide?

## 2. Let's start with "why"

Let's start with "why"! Nowadays, AI is everywhere - literally everywhere. All companies claim to be introducing it just for the sake of advertising with this magic key word: "AI". So let's look into our current system, business needs and market estimations to see what we want to achieve. 

### Demand
The company plans to expand to new markets, which will generate up to 10 times more certification applications than we currently process. On top of that, the market is expected to grow by 21% in the next 4 years. It means, that in 2029 we'll face up to 2400 candidates per week. Without any changes to our process, we'll need around 25.000 work-hours of our experts per week.

### Throughput
Let's see if it's doable. Currently our contractors work around 8 hours per week. To meet such high demand, we would need to increase headcount by 200%. Alternatively, we could switch to full-time employment, but still we would need to extend to 500 employees. Not only it's very costly, it's probably impossible, as there are not enough experts out there.

## 3. Introducing AI

Ok, now we know. If we don't act now, we'll soon drown in applications. We need to ask machines for help to speed things up. Let's take a look at how, or where exactly, AI assistance can be added.

## 4. Time is crucial, but it's not everything

To keep up with the market, we must provide results faster, but it can't be just ANY result. We still need to make sure the assessment is fair and accurate. That's how we intent to achieve it.

### Confidence level
First of all, we want to extend the prompt, so that the AI answer include confidence level on top of the response assessment itself. This will allow us to disregard potentially inaccurate assessments, as well as emphasize the ones that are considered certain.

### Human approval
Secondly, we want AI to provide its feedback, but still want a human expert to approve it. Our system will present the full set of AI assessments, and leave it for the employee to quickly scan through them to either confirm or reject the result, question by question.

### Multiple models, multiple prompts
And finally, since AI processing is not deterministic, we call for a bit of statistics to help us. We propose to run each question assessment multiple times, varying both AI model and the prompt. Some prompt strategies may prove more efficient with a given question that the others. This way, we can limit the errors to minimum, by crossing out extremes and extracting averages.

## 5. Let's take a step further

Ok, we took care about the core functionality in our system. We saved a lot of time of our experts. It's great, but it's not the only work we do every day. So, since we have the technology there, why not to take a step further, and use the same mechanism for continuous improvement and automated issue monitoring?

### Notes
- Here we'll explain how we plan to use AI for pass rate analysis and test update verification.

## 6. Conclusion

It doesn't have to end here. There's no such thing as a perfect product. But let's not jump ahead of us. We first need to see this part through.
Thank you for hearing us out. See you on the road!
