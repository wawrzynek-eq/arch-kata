# Video Presentation Transcript

## 1. Introduction

Hello everyone!
We call ourselves KnowledgeOutOfRangeException and today we'd like to show you our humble proposition for how to improve the grading system with AI-assisted solutions. Without any further a due... Let's crack on!

### Notes
 - How about a personal touch - our photos on the first slide?

## 2. Let's start with "why"

Let's start with "why"! Nowadays, AI is everywhere - literally everywhere. All companies claim to be introducing it just for the sake of advertising with this magic key word: "AI". So let's look into our current system, business needs and market estimations to see what we want to achieve.

### Notes
- Here we should put some charts showing when and how we'll hit our limit

## 3. Introducing AI

Ok, now we know. If we won't act now, we'll soon drown in applications. We need to ask machines for help to speed things up. Let's take a look how, or where exactly, AI assistance can be added.

### Notes
- Some graphs presenting where we put the AI elements

## 4. Don't forget about quality

To keep up with the market, we must provide results faster, but it can't be just ANY result. We still need to make sure the assessment is fair and accurate.
[TODO]

### Notes
- Here we'll describe how we keep errors to the minimum and how humans are still there to double-check/confirm assessment.
- Multiple models, different prompts, 

## 5. Let's take a step further

Ok, we took care about the core functionality in our system. We saved a lot of time of our experts. It's great, but it's not the only work we do every day. So, since we have the technology there, why not to take a step further, and use the same mechanism for continuous improvement and automated issue monitoring?

### Notes
- Here we'll explain how we plan to use AI for pass rate analysis and test update verification.

## 6. Conclusion

It doesn't have to end here. There's no such thing as a perfect product. But let's not jump ahead of us. We first need to see this part through.
Thank you for hearing us out. See you on the road!
